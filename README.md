# C-_PROJECTS
C++ projects for beginners

1) Currency Converter
One of the best ways to revise basic concepts is to build a basic project, and there’s nothing easier than a converter. All you have to do is take input of the currency required and display the output accordingly. There also needs to be a way to customize the currencies from some sort of menu or dropdown. Data for the conversion can be fetched from an external file, or simply stored as a separate module.

A converter should have some validation to ensure that the conversion works only on numeric data. An error should be displayed for invalid data accordingly.

One addition that the project demands is in the value of the currency for conversion. A static file or module would mean that the currency values don’t manually change with time. Fetching data for updating these values from the Internet will not only give a more accurate result, but it will also help one build their networking concepts and build a better project (overall).

2) Credit Card Validator
In this digital world where e-commerce is ruling the roost, credit cards are everywhere. Most payment gateways use some sort of validation mechanism for credit card data before proceeding with the payment. What if there was software to perform this validation from the get-go? The validation works differently for different cards, so determining what type of card it is and then checking if the number entered is a valid credit card number or not is the way to go.

If things become a bit too complicated from the get-go, it’s okay to implement a drop-down or menu for selecting which type of card to check against. This project is extremely simplistic in terms of design but will require some knowledge of algorithms if one proceeds with building it.

3) Digital Calculator
This is one project you probably expected to see on the list, didn’t you? It is one of the easiest C++ projects to get started with is a calculator. This project is mainly GUI-driven, making it easy to implement. It will be a menu-driven program where the outputs will be provided by the user. It helps reinforce some of the basic concepts of C++, especially that of data types and decision-making statements.

The project needs validation for the inputs so that the calculation only happens if the data inserted is numerical by nature. Also, there’s some concept of data handling or the handling of data of a particular size. The bigger the number, the bigger the data type needed to handle it. Handling it appropriately will also require some skill – something that will go a long way in helping one secure an internship/job in the future.
