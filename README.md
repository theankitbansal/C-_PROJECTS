# C-_PROJECTS
C++ projects for beginners

1) Currency Converter
One of the best ways to revise basic concepts is to build a basic project, and there’s nothing easier than a converter. All you have to do is take input of the currency required and display the output accordingly. There also needs to be a way to customize the currencies from some sort of menu or dropdown. Data for the conversion can be fetched from an external file, or simply stored as a separate module.

A converter should have some validation to ensure that the conversion works only on numeric data. An error should be displayed for invalid data accordingly.

One addition that the project demands is in the value of the currency for conversion. A static file or module would mean that the currency values don’t manually change with time. Fetching data for updating these values from the Internet will not only give a more accurate result, but it will also help one build their networking concepts and build a better project (overall).

2) Credit Card Validator
In this digital world where e-commerce is ruling the roost, credit cards are everywhere. Most payment gateways use some sort of validation mechanism for credit card data before proceeding with the payment. What if there was software to perform this validation from the get-go? The validation works differently for different cards, so determining what type of card it is and then checking if the number entered is a valid credit card number or not is the way to go.

If things become a bit too complicated from the get-go, it’s okay to implement a drop-down or menu for selecting which type of card to check against. This project is extremely simplistic in terms of design but will require some knowledge of algorithms if one proceeds with building it.

3) Digital Calculator
This is one project you probably expected to see on the list, didn’t you? It is one of the easiest C++ projects to get started with is a calculator. This project is mainly GUI-driven, making it easy to implement. It will be a menu-driven program where the outputs will be provided by the user. It helps reinforce some of the basic concepts of C++, especially that of data types and decision-making statements.

The project needs validation for the inputs so that the calculation only happens if the data inserted is numerical by nature. Also, there’s some concept of data handling or the handling of data of a particular size. The bigger the number, the bigger the data type needed to handle it. Handling it appropriately will also require some skill – something that will go a long way in helping one secure an internship/job in the future.

4) Tic-Tac-Toe
C++ is used for the production of a majority of gaming software around the planet. One of the world’s most powerful gaming engines, the Unreal Engine, is powered by C++. No doubt building a simple game in C++ will help show off your skills in a big way. What could be more basic than the tic-tac-toe game that we all played during a boring class in school or college?

Tic-Tac-Toe itself isn’t very difficult to implement. However, it does help one revisit some of the algorithms that one had learned while learning the language. You have to come up with the logic for deciding the winner while continuously swapping players when one player has played their move is going to take some time to implement.

Want to take things up a notch? Use the socket library to make the game a multiplayer game that can be played over the Internet by two players. This might not seem very easy, but it will help boost one’s networking concepts in a big way. It is also a great idea for a fun python project.

5) Stopwatch
One of the easiest ways to get started in C++ is to start with work in GUI-based applications – stuff that doesn’t have too much functionality, to begin with. That’s exactly why something like a timer or a stopwatch has graced the list. It’s easy to build and helps one brush up their basics with the graphics library that comes with C++. One can create their class for manipulating time or simply go with the predefined classes given within the language. Time should be counted down with a periodic function that keeps executing every second.

The GUI could be made as feature-rich as possible to help make the project look more appealing. The option to store past recordings in some file or simply display them in the application is an improvement that can be implemented pretty easily.

6) Student Management System
If things are going smoothly till now, it’s time to take it up a notch. Most projects are pretty straightforward and in what they accomplish. There are some projects, however, where the requirements are variable and can be designed as needed. The more functionality that one provides, the better. An average student management system needs to consider multiple types of users – teachers and students – and allow them to do particular stuff based on the privileges granted. Students should be able to edit their details, submit their assignments, and sit for tests set by teachers. Teachers should be able to set assignments and tests and grade students depending on their performance while being able to change their details. It is one of the most popular C++ projects among beginners, especially for school or college project submissions.

If things get a bit too basic with this system, the addition of a third type of user – parent – is recommended. Parents should only be able to view a student’s details and their marks – they should not be able to edit anything. That being said, the system also can be improved in a lot of other ways, so it’s good to add features as and when required.
